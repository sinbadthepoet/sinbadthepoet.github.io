### BALISSET - Balistics and Logic Immersive Sim Systems & Editor Tools ###

[BALLISET is in early development, but you can check out the git repo here!](https://github.com/sinbadthepoet/BALISSET)

BALISSET is a foundation for building games within the immersive sim design philosophy. Taking inspiration from [Cogito](https://github.com/Phazorknight/Cogito), a similar project template for the GODOT game engine, BALISSET will provide developers a foundation to start building their Immersive Sim projects in **Unity**.

BALISSET started out as an exercise in my own technical design skills, and as the foundation for project I was hoping to work towards called Project Fuse. The idea to publish the project as open source, and put effort into improving the workflow came from COGITO. Now, BALISSET is being worked on by a small team, targetting a release in September 2024.

The framework is planning to include the following features:
- A sophisticated inheritance hierarchy and smart use of interfaces to allow for easily expandable code.
- Modular equipment, weapon, and power systems to allow designers and programmers to work more independently.
- Highly customizable melee weapon and firearm systems.
- A highly polished, customizable and highly mobile Player Prefab fully integrated with BALISSET's systems.
- The ability to quickly and easily create new systemic attributes such as flammable or conductive, and add them to objects.
- Dynamic world elements like crates, lights, doors, and more than can all react to outside stimuli.
- Custom editor interfaces and improved debug rendering to improve workflows for designers.

BALISSET was primarily designed to aid my own future development of Immersive Sim projects, and is modeled to be a mix of **Deus Ex (2000)** Style Interfaces with **Arkane** style game feel. However, we hope to make this project useful for others as a way to jumpstart their own immersive sim projects or to help them prototype mechanics, and plan to make these systems easy to modify or replace for developers targetting a different vision.
