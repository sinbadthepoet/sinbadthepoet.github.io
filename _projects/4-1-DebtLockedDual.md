WINNER OF UNITY'S CHOICE FOR BEST USE OF GAME ENGINE AT GAMECON 2023
============

### NOMINEE FOR BEST THIRD YEAR GAME AT GAMECON 2023 ###

Debtlocked Dual was the third-year project game from my team Infinite Monkey Theorem. In this 2-4 player online or split-screen party game, players must play through a variety of minigames created from a combination of two mechanics. Between Falling Platforms, Dodgeballs, Flying Robot Bumpers and more, there are tonnes of possible combinations to experience!

My Role
------------

Debtlocked Dual was a project that I worked on as a designer. The game was built around the idea of creating small, modular game elements that we can reuse in pairs (hence 'duals') to create fun game mode combinations. As my first project where I could be dedicated to the role of design (while also doing all the gameplay programming for the modular mechanics), I got the opportunity to iterate on game concepts to make them more complex.

One example where iteration allowed us to completely evolve a concept was the bumper. This started as a traditional, simple, Wipeout-style bumper. It would spin on its axis, act as a big arm, and just do that. Simple to program, simple to understand. However, it was super boring and didn't allow for particularly interesting strategies. Rather than leaving it as is, I took the opportunity to revamp the design and see how we could keep the threat of being pushed off while adding depth.

That's how I landed on the new, robotic bumpers. These robots would follow a part that designers could place, scan for nearby players, and speed up constantly. If a player gets too close, the bumper will chase them. Players could then run past another player, and pass the bumper off to them. It offered a risk and reward, as the bumper would pick up speed constantly, and push players further the faster they go. Is it worth the risk to catch a bumper just for the chance that you might be able to pass it off to a friend?

Of course, we also had to consider how the bumper would interact with other mechanics. Players could use Dodgeballs to hit the bumper and trigger its hit effect, draining it of its power while also launching the ball at a high speed and potentially hitting another player thanks to the ball's auto aim. How did the patrolling bumpers affect the level design of maps built around hot zones, such as the ones using the spinning Pachinko launcher?

Ultimately, Debtlocked Dual was an imperfect project, with lots of lessons learned along the way. We ran into technical issues and classes resulted in time constraints, but I'm still proud of what we made!

Here's some gameplay! Unfortunately, the audio had to be muted because the players were simply having too much fun.
