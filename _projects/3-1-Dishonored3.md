[You can find an early, high level draft of the document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RJrWDRj_b_p5VogWciIO_4T_7RIOkvc8JwoqEyljlbo/edit){:target="_blank"}

An in progress design document for a theoretical Dishonored 3 protagonist. This document was created initially as practice, but is now serving as the basis for our promotional demo for [BALISSET](https://sinbadthepoet.github.io/projects/1-1-balisset/){:target="_blank"}. The promotional demo will help show people the power of BALISSET and it's ability to prototype immersive sim concepts, so expect to see this document evolve as we discover what plays well and what doesn't!

Currently, the primary focus is creating interesting powers with multiple uses that fit well within the systemic sandbox of the games. Each power includes a set of examples as to how the power might be used.
