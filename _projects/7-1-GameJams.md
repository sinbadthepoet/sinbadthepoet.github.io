Participating in GMTK Game Jam 2024!

### Global Game Jam 2024 - Organizer ###

#### Frankenstein on Ice (GD Jam 2023) - Mentor for First Year Game Development Students, Organizer ####

This year I was President of the GDSA, and did not have the have the time to fully commit to participating in the Game Jam as I was helping to run it! Instead, I opted to mentor students with less development experience and offered to help teach them about Unity and help them work past any issues they had.

### Convergence (Global Game Jam 2023) - Level Designer, Programmer ###

Inspired by Effect and Cause and A Crack in the Slab, this project was a fun attempt at learning about stealth systems! As with many of my Game Jam projects, it was definitely overscoped and having to leave the project early didn't help. Still, it was fun to work on.

### Rewinders (GD Jam 2022) - Lead Game Designer, Programmer ###

Rewinders is a simple top down shooter where the arena loops temportally! After each round, the previous round plays out as a real time input recreation, and players need to navigate around the obstacles of previous rounds. Unfortunately, this project was scoped for a bigger team but some members of the team left before they could contribute, but too late for us to rescope, and the project didn't function properly in the end as we ran into input issues with Unity. I wanted to call this project clock blockers but they wouldn't let me.

### Polarity (Global Game Jam 2022) - Solo Non-Artist Developer ###

I worked on this Game Jam with a couple of artist friends and got to really set the tone of the game myself. I didn't account for how the objects would interact with each other in an actual level so there are some weird shenanigans when you actually play it, but it's a fun idea!

### Pizza Parker (GD Jam 2021) - Designer, Programmer ###

My first Game Jam project! Pizza Parker was a silly little game where you play ping pong with a firing ball of pizza dough. This was my first experience with Unity and I got help from upper year students for mentorship.
