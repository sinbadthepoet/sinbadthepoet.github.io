A social and emotional game built to share the struggles of the working class in the modern era, this game makes use of patents and practices of companies like Amazon to create a funny experience commenting on the absurdity of their exploitation. This game was designed for Ontario Tech's Social and Emotional Game Design course in a presentation format which is now lost, but we do have the proof of concept available online.

Notice how 50+% of your screen is covered with useless bullshit. The Wage Cage itself also has tank controls and can only turn while moving forward. Enjoy the tight spaces you must navigate! The full game would feature a tight time limit, a stress meter you cannot reduce via any method, and a piss meter that eventually makes you piss yourself. At some point, I'd like to turn this into a full game that runs about 10-30 minutes, focused on humor.

Here's some gameplay from the prototype! It's just focused on exploring whether the core gameplay loop allows players to engage with the core theme of the game effectively, which we surveyed positively for!
