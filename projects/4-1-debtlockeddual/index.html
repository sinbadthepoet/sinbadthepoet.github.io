<p>Debtlocked Dual was the third year project game from my team Infinite Monkey Theorem. In this 2-4 player online or splitscreen party game, players must play through a variety of minigames created from a combination of two mechanics. Between Falling Platforms, Dodgeballs, Flying Robot Bumpers and more, there are tonnes of possible combinations to experience!</p>

<h2 id="my-role">My Role</h2>

<p>Debtlocked Dual was a project that I worked on as a designer. The game was built around the idea of creating small, modular game elements that we can reuse in pairs (hence ‘duals’) to create fun gamemode combinations. As my first project where I could be dedicated to the role of design (while also doing all the gameplay programming for the modular mechanics), I got the opportunity to iterate on game concepts to make them more complex.</p>

<p>One example where iteration allowed us to completely evolve a concept was the bumper. This started out as a traditional, simple, Wipeout style bumper. It would spin on it’s axis, act as a big arm, and just do that. Simple to program, simple to understand. However, it was super boring and didn’t allow for particularly interesting strategies. Rather than leaving it as is, I took the opportunity to revamp the design, and see how we could keep the threat of being pushed off, while adding depth.</p>

<p>That’s how I landed on the new, robotic bumpers. These robots would follow a part that designers could place, and scan for nearby players and speeding up constantly. If a player gets too close, the bumper would chase them. Players could then run past another player, and pass the bumper off to them. It offered a risk and reward, as the bumper would pick up speed constantly, and push players further the faster they go. Is it worth the risk to catch a bumper just for the chance that you might be able to pass it off to a friend?</p>

<p>Of course, we also had to consider how the bumper would interact with other mechanics. Players could use Dodgeballs to hit the bumper and trigger it’s hit effect, draining it of it’s power while also launching the ball at a high speed and potentially hitting another player thanks to the ball’s autoaim. How did the patrolling bumpers affect the level design of maps built around hotzones, such as the ones using the spinning pachinko launcher?</p>

<p>Ultimately, Debtlocked Dual was an imperfect project, with lots of lessons learned along the way. We ran into technical issues and classes resulted in time constraints, but I’m still proud of what we made!</p>
